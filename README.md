# Citius Invaders
A Citius invaders game. Learned the rules from Siraj Raval.

## Elements
- A Spaceship
- Enemies
- Bullets

## How to Play
- Press the left arrow key to move the spaceship to the left.
- Press the right arrow key to move the spaceship to the right.

## Rules
- When a bullet collides with an enemy, the bullet and the enemy get deleted.
- If there are 4 enemies on the screen, you're not allowed to shoot any bullets any more.
- If there are 100 enemies on the screen, you've lost the game.
- The enemies reproduce every 5 seconds (this amount of time decreases every generation).
